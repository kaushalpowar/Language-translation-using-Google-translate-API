This a Language translator project.<br/>
In this project I used Googletrans library, which is a free and unlimited python library that implemented Google Translate API. <br/>
Checkout details about Googletrans [here](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/).<br/>

If you go through the code you will notice I have not specified which language I am giving as an input. This library will auto-detects it.<br/>
I gave Hindi input string and translated it into English.<br/>


Following Image ⬇︎ shows the Translated sentence that I have done.<br/>
